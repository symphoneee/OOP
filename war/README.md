# WAR
##Object Oriented Programming - Spring 2019

###Implement the game of War.

> In this implementation of war I have tried to abstract the different classes as much as possible. There is a seperate class for each step of the process allowing easy fixes in certain classes instead of disrupting the whole system. It begins with the Card class where a simple card is formed with a Rank and Suit. It then moves to the Deck class where there are functions that use the Card class to form a Deck of cards, shuffle it, return the Rank of the card, and display the contents of the cards. Then it moves to a player class which can call up the deck class and there are functions in the player class which allow the player to create a deck that they posses. Then finally, the game class allows access to the player class so that in the game class a player can be created. In main.cpp the only call is to one game class that is created and inside that class two players are created, dealt cards, and the cards are compared and a total of wins is kept for each player. At the end of the simulation the programs alerts the user of which player has won.
