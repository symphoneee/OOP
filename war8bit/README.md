# WAR
Object Oriented Programming - Spring 2019

Implement the game of war using a tagged Union.

In this version of my implementation I have used a tagged union in order
to implement a joker card into the deck.  For now, the joker card only 
holds the property of color, which is red or black. Every card, joker or regurlar, is now asserted to be a standard card.
